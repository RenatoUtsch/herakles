// Herakles renderer binary scene format.
//
// This format is described in such a way that a scene file can be memory mapped
// and easily transferred to the GPU memory and used as GLSL structures.
//
// A file in this format *can* be written by hand using the FlatBuffer JSON
// representation, but as it was designed with performance in mind, it will
// likely not be easy to do. Instead, a better idea is to write a scene in
// another format (like the PBRT format subset) and use a converter.
